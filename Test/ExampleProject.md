## The example project will be a simple data logger with visualization
# What is a Data Logger?
Is a equipment, or device, or software, that is able to record data from somewhere into some place. And it does that following some rules, as in:
* if the temperature is greater than 
* do 
What are going to log?
* CPU temperature
* CPU Usage
* Memory usage

Domotics project

light-switches
    simple lights (ON/OFF)

power-inlets
    simple power supply (110/220)

action-devices 
    electric gates (sensor-less action - ACT)
    garage door (sensor action OPEN/CLOSE  isOpen/isClosed)

full devices 
    air-conditioning (sensor-full and operation )

sensors
    sensor devices that return a value when asked

automation processes
    simple state-machine (turn-on device one, wait for something, turn-on device 2, wait for another something, select device 3, etc)
    simple closed loop (while variable not something, keep ACT)

loging processes
    get information of all devices in the network

show status
    show status of devices, processes, sensors


a mesh structure of all devices connected through a network
one or many servers
operations
